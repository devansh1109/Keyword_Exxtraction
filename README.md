# Keyword_Exxtraction
Extracting keywords from a text summary,  in this case extracting keywords from a csv file containing abstracts of multiple research papers.
We have used Tf-idf vectorization pre-trained model and fine tuned it according to our needs to extract keywords from the abstracts stored in our csv file.
This method is effective and is pretty fast in generating response even for bigger csv files.

To run this code run the jupyter notebook in your machine and replace the path to the file and also the columns that stores the summary.
